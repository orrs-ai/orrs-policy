    <h1>Terms &amp; Conditions</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated April 24, 2025</strong></p>

    <h2>1. Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms &amp; Conditions (<strong>“Terms”</strong>) are a legally binding agreement
      between you (<strong>“you”</strong>) and <strong>Open Records Request Solutions&nbsp;LLC</strong>
      (<strong>“ORRS,” “we,” “our,”</strong> or <strong>“us”</strong>) governing your access
      to and use of <a href="https://orrs.ai">orrs.ai</a> and any related sub‑domains,
      web applications, or services we own or operate (collectively, the
      <strong>“Site”</strong>).
      By accessing or using the Site you confirm that (i) you have read,
      understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms; and (ii) you are at least
      18&nbsp;years of age and have the authority to enter into these Terms on behalf of
      yourself or the entity you represent. If you do not agree, you must not use
      the Site.
    </p>

    <h2>2. About ORRS &amp; Our Services</h2>
    <p>
      ORRS provides an automation‑ and AI‑powered software platform that helps
      U.S.&nbsp;public school districts manage, track, and fulfill public
      records (FOIA / CORA) requests more efficiently. The Site
      may describe our products, allow you to request a demo, and enable you to
      contact us for support or information. The Site itself does <em>not</em> create
      an attorney‑client relationship, does not constitute legal advice, and
      should not be relied upon as such.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. If we make material changes,
      we will revise the <em>“Last updated”</em> date above and may provide
      additional notice at our discretion (e.g.&nbsp;via email or prominent
      notice on the Site). Your continued use of the Site after any update means
      you accept the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Intellectual‑Property Rights</h2>
    <p>
      The Site and all content, code, trademarks, and other materials
      displayed&nbsp;— other than user‑generated content&nbsp;— are owned by ORRS or its
      licensors and are protected by U.S.&nbsp;and international intellectual‑property
      laws. You receive a limited, revocable, non‑transferable license to access
      and use the Site for its intended business purposes. Except as expressly
      permitted, you may not copy, reproduce, modify, distribute, or create
      derivative works from any part of the Site without our prior written
      consent.
    </p>

    <h2>5. User Responsibilities &amp; Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Site for any unlawful, deceptive, or fraudulent purpose;</li>
      <li>Upload or transmit viruses, malware, or other harmful code;</li>
      <li>Reverse‑engineer, decompile, or otherwise attempt to discover the
          Site’s source code except to the extent such restriction is prohibited
          by law;</li>
      <li>Use any automated means (bots, scrapers, etc.) without our prior
          written permission;</li>
      <li>Interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Site
          or its underlying infrastructure; or</li>
      <li>Misrepresent your affiliation with any person or entity, or
          impersonate another user.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Your use of the Site is also governed by our
      <a href="/orrs-policy/privacy" target="_blank">Privacy&nbsp;Policy</a>, which is
      incorporated into these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>7. AI &amp; Automation Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Our Services leverage machine‑learning models and automated
      workflows. While we strive for accuracy and reliability, outputs generated
      by AI may occasionally contain errors or omissions. You acknowledge that
      you are responsible for independently verifying any information produced
      by the Services before relying on it, and that ORRS makes no warranties
      regarding the accuracy, completeness, or fitness for a particular purpose
      of such outputs.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>
      THE SITE AND SERVICES ARE PROVIDED “AS&nbsp;IS” AND “AS&nbsp;AVAILABLE.” TO
      THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ORRS DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES,
      WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTIES OF
      MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE, AND
      NON‑INFRINGEMENT. ORRS DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SITE WILL BE
      UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR‑FREE, OR SECURE.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL ORRS, ITS
      OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, OR AGENTS BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL,
      SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS OR
      REVENUE, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO YOUR USE OF (OR INABILITY TO USE)
      THE SITE OR SERVICES, EVEN IF ORRS HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY
      OF SUCH DAMAGES. IN NO EVENT WILL ORRS’S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE
      GREATER OF <strong>$100</strong> OR THE AMOUNT YOU PAID TO ORRS (IF ANY)
      IN THE 12&nbsp;MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>
      You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless ORRS and its affiliates
      from and against any claims, damages, losses, and expenses (including
      reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or related to (i) your
      violation of these Terms; (ii) your misuse of the Site; or (iii) your
      violation of any rights of a third party.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law &amp; Dispute Resolution</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Colorado, without
      regard to its conflict‑of‑laws rules.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Informal Resolution (Required).</strong> Before filing a claim,
      the parties agree to attempt to resolve any dispute arising out of these
      Terms or the Services informally and in good faith for at least
      <strong>60&nbsp;days</strong> after written notice of the dispute.</p>
    <p><strong>Binding Arbitration.</strong> If the dispute is not resolved
      informally, it will be finally and exclusively settled by binding
      arbitration administered by the American Arbitration Association
      (“AAA”) under its Commercial Arbitration Rules. The arbitration will
      take place in <strong>Teller&nbsp;County, Colorado</strong> (or remotely
      at the arbitrator’s discretion). <strong>Class actions are not
      permitted.</strong> Judgment on the award may be entered in any court
      having jurisdiction.</p>
    <p>
      Either party may seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of
      competent jurisdiction to protect its intellectual‑property rights.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the Site at
      any time, with or without notice, for conduct that we believe violates
      these Terms or is otherwise harmful to other users or ORRS.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Miscellaneous</h2>
    <p>
      If any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that
      provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary,
      and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect. Our
      failure to enforce any right or provision will not be deemed a waiver of
      such right or provision.
